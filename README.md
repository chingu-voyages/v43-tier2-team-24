## Future work
- Clicking on a sidebar button should toggle the corresponding widget on/off on the board
- Allow for full functionality of each widget
- Enable sidebar buttons to persist after refresh (e.g. localStorage, cookies)
- Implement feature to allow users to change background images and enable light/dark modes
- Features to allow users to increase available widgets on board (via easy-to-use buttons and/or plugin architecture)
